<h3>Windows Phone Officially No.3 Smartphone OS Worldwide</h3>
<p>IDC released its Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker for Q1'13. According to the report with its 3.2% market share&nbsp; Windows Phone is now the third most widely used mobile OS in the world, displacing Blackberry.</p>
<p><img src="/upload/news/image_thumb_280.png" alt="" width="350" /></p>
<p>According to the report:</p>
<p><em>Windows Phone claiming the third spot is a first and helps validate the direction taken by Microsoft and key partner Nokia," said Kevin Restivo, senior research analyst with IDC's Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker. "Given the relatively low volume generated, the Windows Phone camp will need to show further gains to solidify its status as an alterative to Android or iOS." <br />Windows Phone posted the largest year-over-year gain among the leading operating systems, more than doubling its size from a year ago.</em></p>
